Stran is a game tool for the populate webgame Travian.
It now contains a multi-language user interface, and can do lots of actions like build or celebrate in queue.
Now I'm glad to release its source code under MPL 1.1 and hope more and more people take parts in the project.

**You should have installed .net Framework 2.0 before using this tool.**
